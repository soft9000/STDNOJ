.REM Directory documentation.

EzLog is a command line utility. It has been designed
to log its content either to the pwd, to a file higher 
up in the directory tree, or to a file located next to
wherever the program itself is located. Each option is
supported by a single command-line character.

Very handy tool. When used with the "@" parameter, it
even makes for a handy geek blogging tool. -A good 
way to keep track of things that you did for the day, 
are billing a client for (etc.) I have come to rely
upon it a lot.

Note that for proper browser viewing, the graphic files 
in this folder need to be deployed next to the executable.
