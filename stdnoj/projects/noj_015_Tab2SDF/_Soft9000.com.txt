TAB to Space Delimited Format (SDF)
-----------------------------------
I cobbled this NOJ together while struggling with 
the need to expand a tab-delimited file into something 
more viewable. e.g:

Tool Usage
==========
(1) Create a funky tab file -
MYDIR> RTree # > REPORT.TAB

(2) Use Tab2SDF to view the content
MYDIR> Tab2SFD REPORT.TAB

	Or

(2) Use Tab2SDF to view the content
MYDIR> Tab2SFD REPORT.TAB > REPORT.SDF

Piped Usage
===========
(1) You can also use this noj as a pipe-fitting

MYDIR> RTree # | sort | Tab2SDF ! > REPORT.SDF
                                ^
* - My personal preference for a pipe mode indicator is [!]

How it Works:
=============
This program scans the REPORT.TAB file twice.
   Once to determine the optimal fill for each field and
   Once to display file content to cout / stdout.

Simple yet very handy, this C++ tool is also neat for 
people who work with legacy COBOL data file / dataset 
formats. The perfect NOJ!
