.REM Directory documentation.

Microsoft Operating Systems have always been "command 
line challenged." I cobbled this NOJ together while 
struggling with the need to create scripts or batch files
that will list a directory tree in a node-sortable order.
Great for reviewing the output in a spread sheet. e.g:

\MYDIR> RTree # | SORT > \REPORT.TAB

Demonstrates how to use recursion today via a modern 
C++ namespace. Will work on any supported OS. See the
PathChar() usage to see how easy it can be.

If you suspect that you have a lot of duplicate nodes 
in a tree, then RTREE can be a very handy tool to have
on your path.
