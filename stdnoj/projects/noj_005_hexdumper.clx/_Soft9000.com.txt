NojView: This program is a portable (WIN32 / Linux) hex 
dumper / text viewer. While simple, it demonstrates how 
to use some Borland's CLX / VCL components, as well as the 
stdnoj::ByteBuffer. Requires Borland's CLX.

Note that the project file is for WIN32. Will work
on Linux, but you will need to convert or recreate
the project file using Kylix, first.

Project built with Borland C++Builder 6.
