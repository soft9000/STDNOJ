Animating PopServer in such a way so as to manage any

on the command line. Subject forms the basis for the 
file name.

We think people now need (2008/11) to see the source code, 
but this version of the project (_SUPPORT) was released to 
the public. Do we need to re-create a back-release that 
works with STDNOJ, or release a lib-only version?
