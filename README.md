# STDNOJ
The "Neat Odd Job" Library - also known as the "STDNOJ Namespace" is our traditional, cross-platform, C/C++ library.

My STDNOJ Namespace features over 600 classes for Web, RFC & File Management.

MISSION: Develop cross-platform tools faster using a C++ Framework proven in commercial software. 

## STDNOJ Features:
Classes support logging, sockets, object indexing, ini, tagged databases, file systems, and more.

### RFC Support
Classic support for RFC Servers includes NNTP, SMTP, POP, HTTP.

### Cross-platform:
Tested on every C/C++ classic compiler:
* GCC
* Visual Studio
* NetBeans & Eclipse
* DJPP
* XCode
* C++Builder

Whilst my more Modern C/C++ efforts have moved well past the STDNOJ Namespace, the STDNOJ project is maintained. Feel free to bookmark, or fork-in your changes?

Cheers,
