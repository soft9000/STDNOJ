<P>When it comes to software creation, making a project </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=5 COLOR="#ffff00">n</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff">eat is about re-use: The kind of copying that allows us to do some <I>very</I> cool things. </P>
<P>Combing speed and re-use together is what the </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=5 COLOR="#ffff00">N</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff">eat </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=5 COLOR="#ffff00">O</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff">dd </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=5 COLOR="#ffff00">J</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff">ob Project is all about. </P>
<P>The bonus of this project is that our selection of the </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00">MIT License</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff"> allows you to use our source code in your commercial applications just like I want to... without having to release your entire product to the Open Source World.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00"><P>So relax: </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff">As long as you agree to give credit where credit is due by keeping our copyrights intact in your source code, then you can leverage the thousands of man hours in this project. We even offer you a chance to feel less guilty by allowing you to donate and help keep us going.</P>
<P>&nbsp;:-) </P>
<P>No guilt... No blackmail... No lawsuits... </P>
<P>Ever.</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=7 COLOR="#ffff00"><P>U</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff">ntil a class has proven itself many times, an implementation should be free to change. That said, we must also keep in mind that our public interfaces should be viewed as a commitment. They should almost </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffff00">never</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff"> change. While interfaces can increase, they should decrease only through logical succession. </P>
<P>In order to keep our public interfaces intact yet evolving, inheritance and namespaces can be used. Respectively, those allow us either to gradually tailor or "chuck it all" and start over with a better design. Throughout it all, the use of factories and polymorphism can provide one great way to shield developers and users alike from change. </P>
<P>But none of that is required... Which brings us to the third pillar of our project:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=7 COLOR="#ffff00"><P>N</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff">o one should be allowed to interfere with the creative process. While companies will ever insist that software development should become an assembly-line activity, the truth is that no matter what tools you give us, insisting that any artisan create a given number of masterpieces each day only leads to everyone being disappointed. Even when implementing the exact same design, any tenured professional will tell you that different implementations are never equal. Quality simply takes time.</P>
<P>So be our fines ever expressed in terms of cost, quality, or time, in software development as in every else, we truly only get what we pay for. </B></FONT></TD>

<B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=6 COLOR="#00ffff"><P>Conclusion</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff"><P>Give such a cycle of innovation, it just may be that software development is never truly completed... just abandoned. </P>
<P>But not to despair: The fact that software development is a never-ending process does not stop anyone from shipping a product. Upgrades, after all, are what keep software companies in business.</P>
<P>So given that companies ever seem to be doing things over and over again, it just might not be all about deadlines. Appreciating that we humans tend to choose to do what we like to do as often as we are able means that, on a personal note at least, </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=5 COLOR="#ffff00">F.U.N</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4 COLOR="#ffffff"> might just be what it <I>should be</I> all about. Practice, after all, makes for the most predictable means of perfection... At least enough to have kept a few of us toiling at our keyboards since 1978. </P>
<P>So we hope to see you - as well as <I>your</I> "public interfaces" - still smiling and working at your computers in 2078! No more... and certainly no less: rapid accomplishment, elegance, creativity, quality, and enjoyment are the decidedly over-ambitious goals of this project.</B></FONT></TD>
